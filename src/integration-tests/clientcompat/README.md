# Client Compatibility Test

Twirp offers a [client compatability testing tool](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp/tree/main/clientcompat).

The Twirp `clientcompat` testing tool has been vendored into the repo so it does not need to be installed.

```sh
  go install github.com/twitchtv/twirp/clientcompat@latest
```

### First time setup

```
npm run build
```
